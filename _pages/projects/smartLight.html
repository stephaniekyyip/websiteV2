  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    For the final project in my Internet of Things course, my team decided to
    create a smart light system in order to remotely control a LED bulb.
    The idea behind the smart light was to conserve energy by automatically
    adjusting the brightness of the LED depending on the ambient light in the room.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Hardware</h1>
  <p>
    We interfaced the LED bulb, as well as a photoresistor and a transistor, with a Raspberry Pi.
    The photoresistor was used to determine the ambient brightness
    in the room in order to adjust the brightness of the LED accordingly. The
    transistor was used with the battery pack to vary the brightness
    of the LED using the pulse width modulation (PWM) output from the Raspberry Pi.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Software</h1>
  <p>
    To control the LED, I wrote Python scripts to read the input from the photoresistor
    and adjust the LED brightness by varying the PWM output.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to using Python, I used PHP with the Apache server on the Raspberry
    Pi to retrieve the user's input from the webpage and run the appropriate Python
    script.
