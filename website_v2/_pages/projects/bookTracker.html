<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  <a href = "https://still-scrubland-90743.herokuapp.com/">Book Tracker</a>
  is a web app I created as a replacement to the spreadsheet I have
  been using to record all the books I have read since 2008. I wanted to create something with
  a clean and easy-to-use user interface that would allow me to not only record the
  books I have read, but also analyze my reading habits across the past decade.
</p>
<p>
  Besides creating and modifying book entries, users can also search and sort their
  list of books. Other features include the ability to upload a CSV file to bulk add
  book entries and an analytics page that displays the data visualizations and statistics
  of the user's reading habits.
</p>

<h1>How the App Works</h1>
<p>
  I used a tech stack consisting of Apache, PHP,
  and MySQL on the back end, and jQuery on the front end with C3.js/ D3.js
  for data visualization. The live version of the app is hosted on Heroku.
</p>
<p>
  Since this was my first web app, I chose to use technology I had used before,
  including Apache and PHP. I decided not to use any web frameworks or libraries,
  such as React or Laravel, in order to understand the basics, though I quickly understood
  why such technologies can be helpful. Completing this project was a challenge 
  that I enjoyed and learned a lot from.
